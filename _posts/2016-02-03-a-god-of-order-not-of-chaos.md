# A God of order not of chaos

God hovered the darkness... the chaos, and he spoke light into existence. He wanted to give clarity and poise to that which was formless and void, he wanted to being illumination and insight. Light does that. God does that.

When Paul wrote a letter to one of the ancient churches of Asia minor, he told them that whenever they gather, they should do so in an orderly manner so that if any outsiders... non-churchy folk, were to visit or pop in, they would see sane people, in their right mind, doing things and explaining things in such a way that would leave the visitor in awe of God and _not_ thinking they're all just weird and out of control. Churches should look organised not chaotic. They should have systems and processes, much like the way Jesus described it in John 15\. I am the vine, he said, and you, the church, are the branches.

Vines have a system. A root system that ingeniously feeds nutrients to the branches. The branches themselves have leaves that capture sunlight and transform it into energy and life. Water travels systematically throughout the branches from the roots. If a branch is disconnected, the system is broken, the branch begins to wither and die. There needs to be a coherant flow of life within a church. No this is not stifling the spirit, it's managing it's flow so that the branches get fed and grow strong.
