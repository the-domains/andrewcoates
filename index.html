Oswald is designed to be used freely across the internet by web browsers on desktop computers, laptops and mobile devices.","foundry":"google","family":"Oswald","name":"Oswald","normal":3,"bold":3},"screen":{"normal":4,"bold":7,"$formality":-0.09090909090909094,"$type":["sans","grotesque"],"$caps":"normal","foundry":"google","family":"Roboto","name":"Roboto","license":"apache","tags":["sans serif"],"description":"Roboto is an open-source, grotesque sans-serif typeface designed by Christian Robertson in 2011 and released through Google. Despite being accused of being a “frankenfont” mashup of DIN and Helvetica, I’m personally quite fond of Roboto. I think it renders crisply on screens and is very legible, even at smaller sizes.
